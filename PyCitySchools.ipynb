    "- At first glance, students at charter schools appear to be performing better overall than students at public schools. Of the fifteen schools provided, the charter schools are the highest performing by percentage of students passing overall, while the public schools are the lowest performing by percentage of students passing overall. After closer inspection, however, we observe that only one out of the seven charter schools represented in this dataset are considered large, while all eight public schools are considered large. This is significant because the sample size of the public schools is larger than the charter school, resulting in greater variability. It's important to be congnizant of other factors that could be contributing to the trends observed here as well, such as geographic location, and that numbers only tell part of the story.\n",
